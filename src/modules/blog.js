This event is the most interesting event of my life because it was the first tech event I've ever attended. Our speaker, Ayush Chouhan, spoke a lot about blockchain development and Solana. Basically, Solana is a blockchain platform that uses a proof-of-stake mechanism to provide smart contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL. Solana was launched in 2020 by Solana Labs, which was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal in 2018. In June 2021, Solana Labs sold $314 million worth of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, to a group of funds led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital"
